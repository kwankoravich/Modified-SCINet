# Modified-SCINet

## Background

This repository provide modified SCINet model to predict stock price and implement based on PyTorch Framework.

## How to use
```
python main.py
```
## Configuration Setup


The term `seq_len` refers to the number of inputs used for forecasting the output.\
`pred_len` denotes the size or number of steps used to forecast the output at each step.\
`in_dim`represents the number of dimensions in the input, which corresponds to the number of features used as inputs.\
The `kernel` is the 1D convolution kernel, and it should have an odd value (e.g., 3, 5, 7, etc.).
